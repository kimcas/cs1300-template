        <p class="question">Are copiers as easy as they seem?</p>
        <p class="subtext">To answer this question, I observed and interviewed three people on their 
        experience using a copier in a shared office and specifically asked about 
        their experience with the interface. </p>

      <h2>The Product and Interface	&#128424</h2>
      <div class="tabIn">
        <p>Sketches of the copier I studied are below. While this device is a printer,
        copier, scanner, and fax machine all in one, I chose to examine only the copier
        function. The lid opens up so the user can copy or scan a sheet of paper. 
        There is also a touchpad screen in the front. 
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>The lid that opens for the user to place the desired copied sheet.
          The side the user wants to be copied should be placed face down on the screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          The touchpad screen to navigate and change the settings. Since this device 
          can print, copy, scan, and fax, it was necessary for the user to select "Copy"
          as seen on the image on the right.
        </li>
        <li>
          This plastic piece ensures that the paper stays in place rather than 
          falling to the ground once the paper has been copied.
        </li>
        <li>
          This tray holds the blank paper. To reload paper, the user can simply pull
          the tray out and insert more paper.

      <h2>Observations and Interview &#9997</h2>
      <div class="tabIn">
        <p>In order to gain more knowledge on how users interact with the copier, 
        I first observed them use the interface and followed up with questions 
        listed below. 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>On a scale from 1-10 (1 being the worst and 10 being the best), rate the efficiency of the copier.</li>
        <li>What was your thought process when copying the image?</li>
        <li>Have you used a copier before? If yes, how often do you use one?</li>
        <li>What was the most challenging part of the experience, if any?</li>
        <li>How was your experience with the touchpad screen?</li>
        <li>If you could improve the interface of the copier, what would you change?</li>
        <li>What did you like the most? The least?</li>
        <li>On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend this product to a friend? </li>

        <p class="summary">Charles was overall not impressed but satisfied that the printer got the job done. 
          He thought the printer was pretty simple and intuitive, but mentioned that the graphics 
          could’ve been better to indicate which part to open and how to orient the paper. He also 
          didn’t enjoy how loud or long the copier took and was not impressed with the quality of the copy. </p>

          He rated the efficiency of the copier 10/10 and would recommend the copier to a friend due 
          to its good value. The one thing he would change would be to make the touchpad interface larger 
          and add color to the graphics. </p>

          She finds the interface and overall experience simple and easy to understand. She had no

      <p>An observation I found interesting was that all three people stared at the 
        copier while the job was being done (i.e there was nothing left for the user to do).
        I thought this was particularly intriguing because you can audibly hear when the 
        copy job is done, so there is no apparent reason to watch the copier the whole time, 
        but all three of them did so.

      <h2>Personas &#128483</h2>
      <div class="tabIn">
        <p>From the observations and interviews of Charles, Sean, and Mary, I made two personas:
        Relaxed Rose and Meticulous Mark. I took familiarity and assured qualities from Sean and Mary 
        and the more critical aspects from Charles and Sean to formulate these personas. 
      </p>
      <p>During this process, I learned how to create effective personas with goals 
        by determining what the persona thinks, says, does, and feels. By having 
        a persona, you can then create a storyboard or determine how a subset of people
        will use a product and interface. The skill of creating personas can be used
        when first creating a product or reevaluating a product to see how your business will 
        be impacted based on how this persona interacts with the interface.

    <section class="storyboard">
      <h2>Storyboard &#127775</h2>
      <div class="tabIn">
        <p>I chose to create a storyboard inspired by the Relaxed Rose persona. In this 
          storyboard, she utilizes the product, a copier, to help both her co-workers and 
          a babysitter she met on a walk. In the story, you can also see how she interacts
          with the interface, which emphasizes the aspect in her persona that she is an
          experienced user. Additionally, Relaxed Rose, as stated above, genuinely cares 
          about the sucess of her friends, so helping them with their personal lives 
          aligns with Rose's persona.
